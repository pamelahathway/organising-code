1. Import the module `brew_potions.py`  in the `example_usage_inside_package.py` file that lives inside the `brewing` directory: 

   1. import only the `make_example_potion` function and call it
   2. import all the objects in the module and call the  `make_example_potion` function
   3. change the import statement so that you can call the `make_example_potion` function like this: `br.make_example_potion`

2. Import the brewing package from the `example_usage_outside_package.py` that lives at the top level of the repo.
   1. import only the `make_example_potion` function and call it
   2. Does it work?
   3. If yes, why? If no, why not?

3. In the `scripts` folder, there is a file called `example_usage_different_folder.py` that lives in the `scripts` directory. Try to import the `make_example_potion` function from there.
   1. does it work?
   2. If yes, why? If no, why not?
